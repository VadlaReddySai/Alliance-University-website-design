6. Responsiveness
To ensure a seamless user experience on all devices, the website employs responsive design techniques such as:

Flexbox and Grid Layouts: These are used for flexible layouts that adjust automatically to different screen sizes.
Media Queries: These are implemented in the CSS to adapt the design for mobile, tablet, and desktop views.
Font Scaling: Text elements adjust in size for better readability across various devices.
